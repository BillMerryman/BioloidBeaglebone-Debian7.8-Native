These files do the following:

cape-universalx-00A0.dtbo - this is the compiled version of the device tree overlay file , cape-universalx-00A0.dts. Created using the DTBO compiler.

cape-universalx-00A0.dts - this is the source version of the device tree overlay. It is a modified version of the univeral cape overlay, with added support for the PRU Uart (which wasn't available at the time, but has since been added)

config-pin - this is a modified version of the config-pin script, with modifications to add support for the PRU Uart (which wasn't available at the time, but has since been added)

overlayPinConfig.sh - this is a script that is run by the user before launching the main program. It does the following: loads the univeral IO and HDMI-disabling device tree overlays (sometimes referred to synonymously with capes); loads the UIO_PRUSS kernel driver and sets aside 2MB of system memory for use by the PRUs (because of a strange issue, it actually loads it, unloads it, and loads it again); configures all the pins necessary for PRU input, output, and UART; and configures one pin for PWM to drive the camera.

To use these files:

copy the config-pin script to opt/source/beaglebone-universal-io and make executable
copy cape-universalx-00A0.dtbo to lib/firmware
copy overlayPinConfig.sh to whatever directory you will be working from and make executable

Before running the main BioloidBeaglebone program, you must at minimum do the above steps, and then execute the overlayPinConfig.sh (e.g. open a terminal window, switch to the directory where you placed overlayPinConfig.sh, type ./overlayPinConfig.sh, and press enter). This only needs to be done once, and should only be done once, preferrably right after booting has completed. You should also run GRB422-QVGA.sh from the CameraManipulationScripts folder if you are using the GRB422 QVGA version of the camera code, currently the default. This must be run after overlayPinConfig.sh or it will not work.
